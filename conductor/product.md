# Product Guide: WP SEO Pilot

This document outlines the product direction for the WP SEO Pilot plugin.

## Initial Concept

The project is an existing, comprehensive, open-source SEO plugin for WordPress. It features robust control over SEO metadata, sitemaps, redirects, AI-powered suggestions, and more, with a focus on transparency and developer control.

## Next Development Cycle: UI Modernization

The primary strategic goal for the next phase of development is to modernize the plugin's user interface by migrating it to React. This initiative aims to significantly improve the overall user experience (UX) and streamline the onboarding process for new users.

### Phase 1: Core Settings Migration

The first area of focus for the React migration will be the **Main Settings Pages**. This includes areas such as:
- Defaults
- Search Appearance
- Social Settings

Rebuilding these core pages as a single, cohesive React application will serve as the foundation for future UI enhancements.

### Guiding Principles

The migration will be guided by the following principles:

*   **Performance First:** The highest priority is to ensure the new React-based interface is highly performant. Fast load times, smooth transitions, and a responsive user experience are critical success metrics.
*   **Visual Consistency:** The existing visual style is well-regarded and should be preserved. The migration to React is a technical and UX enhancement, not a visual redesign. The new components should adhere to the established look and feel of the plugin.
*   **Improved Onboarding:** While migrating, we will look for opportunities to refine the layout and in-app guidance to make the plugin's powerful features more accessible and easier to configure for all users.
