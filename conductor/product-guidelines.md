# Product Guidelines: WP SEO Pilot

This document outlines the guidelines for the development and design of the WP SEO Pilot plugin, particularly focusing on the new React-based UI for the main settings pages.

## Visual Identity and User Experience

### Design Philosophy: Modern and Seamless Integration
The primary design philosophy for the new React UI is to create a modern and seamless experience that integrates effortlessly with the existing WordPress administrative interface. The goal is to evolve the user experience while maintaining consistency with the familiar environment of WordPress.

### Visual Consistency
A high priority will be placed on preserving the current visual style of the plugin. The React migration is intended to enhance functionality, performance, and user interaction, not to overhaul the visual aesthetic. New components and pages will adhere to the established look, feel, and branding of the WP SEO Pilot plugin.

## User Onboarding and Help

### Contextual Assistance via Inline Tooltips and Hints
To support user onboarding and provide immediate assistance, the new UI will extensively utilize inline tooltips and hints. Small, discreet help icons will be placed next to settings or complex interface elements. On hover or click, these elements will reveal concise, context-sensitive explanations, allowing users to understand functionality without leaving the current page or interrupting their workflow. This approach aims to keep the interface clean while offering readily available support.

## Performance and Responsiveness

### Prioritizing Performance Optimization
Given the user's explicit preference, performance optimization will be a paramount concern throughout the UI migration. The new React components and pages will be engineered for fast loading times, fluid transitions, and highly responsive interactions. This commitment to performance will ensure a smooth and efficient user experience, contributing significantly to overall user satisfaction.
